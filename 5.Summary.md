# Summary

`.git/HEAD` &rightarrow; `.git/refs/heads/master` &rightarrow; `Commit File` &rightarrow; `Tree File` &rightarrow; `Blobs`

Note: _(above strucuture is like an linked list)_

![](imgs/commits.png)

1. `.git/HEAD`: Regular file include ref to .git/refs/heads/branch
2. `.git/refs/heads/branch`: regular file include id of commit file
3. `Commit File`: Include tree file id, parent commit file id, author, committer, commit message.
4. `Tree File`: Include multiple lines representing `permission type blobId filename`
5. `Blob File`: Include content of a file, when added in staging by user.

## Tips

- As soon as files are staged, new object with random id (2d0a....) is created.
- On a commit, latest version of each staged file is stored in commit file. Earlier versions, say if executed git add multiple times between 2 commits, will keep all versions in `.git` folder.
- Branches (`.git/refs/heads/branch`) are just a pointer to a commit file. Thus, Creating branches are easy and cheap.
- HEAD points on one of `.git/refs/heads/branch`.
