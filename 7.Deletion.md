# Deletion

If a branch is deleted, `.git/refs/heads/branch` is removed. Thus, only the pointer to commit file
is removed. The commit file is now orphan.

If a commit file is deleted, `commit file` in `.git/objects` is removed. Thus, only the pointer to tree file, parent commit and commit msg are removed. Tree File is now orphan.
??: does `.git/refs/heads/branch` point to parent commit.
